## What it does
RapydBuddy leverages technology to fill empty seats on the road, connecting members looking to carpool or travel by cab, and making travel more affordable, sociable, convenient, and environment friendly. RapydBuddy is a progressive web app that utilizes the world’s largest local payment network through the Rapyd APIs to make payments scalable globally. With the help of Rapyd, RapydBuddy provides the fastest way to accept and send payments between travelers exploiting the carpool services.
Features
1. RapydBuddy App provides global login to each corporate organization so that a company’s database would be secured within their organization. 
2. Furthermore, these onboarded companies can generate a RapydBuddy EWallet ID for their employees, that can be used to pay or accept payments for the ride. 
3. Employees with their own vehicle can volunteer to provide the ride to their colleagues to their destination and also have the right to put the estimated cost on the ride. And, others who want to carpool, can directly check the availability based on their route and time. 
4. Based on the number of people riding on the same route the amount will be split equally and can be easily paid using Rapyd Wallet.
